bug:Thanks for wanting to report a bug! All of the info you need to report a bug can be found in <#342060723721207810>. The bot syntax can be confusing at first, so make sure to check out the form linked to in that channel.
badge:**Oooo... shiny! I want a badge! How do I get this badge?**
                 + Right now it's only available for Bug Hunters. In the near future we'll be running BH only events where one of the prizes for outstanding participation (read: top placing) will be the Bug Hunter Badge. It also may be a reward for new <#274590523719811074> as well.
                 + **So that means that every Bug Hunter will get one?**
                 + No. You have to be a Bug Hunter before you can participate in the thing that will let you acquire it. It is not automatically given to everyone with the BH role and never will be."
                 + **So only these 'events'? No other way, like, forever?**
                 + The first planned major update for the new version of BugBot will be an extensive XP system, where beneficial actions each grant a certain amount of 'experience points' and if you get enough XP you level up, if you reach certain level milestones you'll earn things like the Badge, as well a t-shirts and a hoodie! Again, this will only be available if you're a Bug Hunter, but anyone can become a Bug Hunter by reporting and getting a bug approved!
hypesquad:**What is HypeSquad??** It is one of Discord's Community Programs where members show their excitement towards Discord. You can check out the website here: <https://discordapp.com/hypesquad>
                     + **I got accepted into HypeSquad as an online member! Where is that totally cool and secret server??**
                     + Unfortunately, there is no server for Online-only anymore. You will however have your badge and newsletter from the Community Team telling you all of the different kind of things you should be excited about.
                     + **I haven't heard anything from HypeSquad, but I got a newsletter.... what's going on?**
                     + You were most likely accepted into the program, but something in the backend borked. Just simply send an email to `hypesquad@discordapp.com` to explain the situation to them, and they will make sure that it is taken care of.
                     + **Is HypeSquad open??**
                     + At the moment, it's only open for event coordinator and attendee. You can keep an eye on the website, <https://discordapp.com/hypesquad> to see when they will be back open for online applications.
                     + Anymore questions? Feel free to contact HypeSquad at `hypesquad@discordapp.com`
